### Hi there 👋

I'm Abraham Menéndez, a 30-year-old Spanish software developer based in Haarlem, The Netherlands (more info on [my website](https://abrahammenendez.com/)).

As I keep creating repositories (most of them private :upside_down_face:), it's getting increasingly difficult to keep them organized. To make our life easier, each repository has now an icon in its description. This is what they mean:
- 💡 Original projects/ideas.
- 🌱 Utils.
- 📚 Courses I've taken.
- 🏆 Challenges/katas/golf.

I hope it helps :)

See you around,\
Abraham
