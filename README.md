### Hi there 👋

I'm Abraham Menéndez, a 30-year-old Spanish software developer based in Amsterdam (more info on [my website](https://abrahammenendez.com/)).

As I create more and more repositories (most of them private), it's getting increasingly difficult to keep them organized. To make our life easier, each repository has now an icon in its description. This is what they mean:
- 💡 Original projects/ideas.
- 🌱 Utils.
- 📚 Courses I've taken.
- 🏆 Challenges/katas/golf.

I hope it helps :)

See you around,\
Abraham
